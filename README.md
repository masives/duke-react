## Duke the game

This project aim is to gime me some playground to learn react, webpack and maybe some more technologies.  
  
As of 19.08.2018 the project is on hold as I'd like to focus on more down to earth stuff.  
  
Remaining work to do contains:
* add more tests
* add duke placement tracking
* add selection canceling
* add drawing mechanics (drawing random unit from pool and placing it)
* add victory mechanics
